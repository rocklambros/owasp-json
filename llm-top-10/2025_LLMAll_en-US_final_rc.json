      "description": "A Prompt Injection Vulnerability occurs when user prompts alter the LLM’s behavior or output in unintended ways. These inputs can affect the model even if they are imperceptible to humans, therefore prompt injections do not need to be human-visible/readable, as long as the content is parsed by the model. \nPrompt Injection vulnerabilities exist in how models process prompts, and how input may force the model to incorrectly pass prompt data to other parts of the model, potentially causing them to violate guidelines, generate harmful content, enable unauthorized access, or influence critical decisions. While techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning aim to make LLM outputs more relevant and accurate, research shows that they do not fully mitigate prompt injection vulnerabilities. \nWhile prompt injection and jailbreaking are related concepts in LLM security, they are often used interchangeably. Prompt injection involves manipulating model responses through specific inputs to alter its behavior, which can include bypassing safety measures. Jailbreaking is a form of prompt injection where the attacker provides inputs that cause the model to disregard its safety protocols entirely. Developers can build safeguards into system prompts and input handling to help mitigate prompt injection attacks, but effective prevention of jailbreaking requires ongoing updates to the model's training and safety mechanisms.",
      "common_examples": [
        "Direct Prompt Injections Direct prompt injections occur when a user's prompt input directly alters the behavior of the model in unintended or unexpected ways. The input can be either intentional (i.e., a malicious actor deliberately crafting a prompt to exploit the model) or unintentional (i.e., a user inadvertently providing input that triggers unexpected behavior). Indirect Prompt Injections Indirect prompt injections occur when an LLM accepts input from external sources, such as websites or files. The content may have in the external content data that when interpreted by the model, alters the behavior of the model in unintended or unexpected ways. Like direct injections, indirect injections can be either intentional or unintentional. The severity and nature of the impact of a successful prompt injection attack can vary greatly and are largely dependent on both the business context the model operates in, and the agency with which the model is architected. Generally, however, prompt injection can lead to unintended outcomes, including but not limited to:",

This manipulation can compromise model security, performance, or ethical behavior, leading to harmful outputs or impaired capabilities.

Understanding these stages helps identify where vulnerabilities may originate. Data poisoning is considered an integrity attack since tampering with training data impacts the model's ability to make accurate predictions. The risks are particularly high with external data sources, which may contain unverified or malicious content. \nMoreover, models distributed through shared repositories or open-source platforms can carry risks beyond data poisoning, such as malware embedded through techniques like malicious pickling, which can execute harmful code when the model is loaded.

Since LLM-generated content can be controlled by prompt input, this behavior is similar to providing users indirect access to additional functionality. Improper Output Handling differs from Overreliance in that it deals with LLM-generated outputs before they are passed downstream whereas Overreliance focuses on broader concerns around overdependence on the accuracy and appropriateness of LLM outputs. Successful exploitation of an Improper Output Handling vulnerability can result in XSS and CSRF in web browsers as well as SSRF, privilege escalation, or remote code execution on backend systems. The following conditions can increase the impact of this vulnerability: \n•The \napplication grants the LLM privileges beyond what is intended for end users, enabling escalation of privileges or remote code execution. \n\n•The \napplication is vulnerable to indirect prompt injection attacks, which could allow an attacker to gain privileged access to a target user's environment. \n\n•3rd\n party extensions do not adequately validate inputs. \n\n•Lack\n of proper output encoding for different contexts (e.g., HTML, JavaScript, SQL) \n\n•Insufficient\n monitoring and logging of LLM outputs \n\n•Absence\n of rate limiting or anomaly detection for LLM usage",

System prompts are designed to guide the model's output based on the requirements of the application, but may inadvertently contain secrets. When discovered, this information can be used to facilitate other attacks. \nIt's important to understand that the system prompt should not be considered a secret, nor should it be used as a security control. Accordingly, sensitive data such as credentials, connection strings, etc. should not be contained within the system prompt language. \nSimilarly, if a system prompt contains information describing different roles and permissions, or sensitive data like connection strings or passwords, while the disclosure of such information may be helpful, the fundamental security risk is not that these have been disclosed, it is that the application allows bypassing strong session management and authorization checks by delegating these to the LLM, and that sensitive data is being stored in a place that it should not be. \nIn short: disclosure of the system prompt itself does not present the real risk --the security risk lies with the underlying elements, whether that be sensitive information disclosure, system guardrails bypass, improper separation of privileges, etc. Even if the exact wording is not disclosed, attackers interacting with the system will almost certainly be able to determine many of the guardrails and formatting restrictions that are present in system prompt language in the course of using the application, sending utterances to the model, and observing the results.",

        "Attackers experiment with popular coding assistants to find commonly hallucinated package names. Once they identify these frequently suggested but nonexistent libraries, they publish malicious packages with those names to widely used repositories. Developers, relying on the coding assistant's suggestions, unknowingly integrate these poised packages into their software. As a result, the attackers gain unauthorized access, inject malicious code, or establish backdoors, leading to significant security breaches and compromising user data.",
        "A company provides a chatbot for medical diagnosis without ensuring sufficient accuracy. The chatbot provides poor information, leading to harmful consequences for patients. As a result, the company is successfully sued for damages. In this case, the safety and security breakdown did not require a malicious attacker but instead arose from the insufficient oversight and reliability of the LLM system. In this scenario, there is no need for an active attacker for the company to be at risk of reputational and financial damage."

      "description": "Unbounded Consumption refers to the process where a Large Language Model (LLM) generates outputs based on input queries or prompts. Inference is a critical function of LLMs, involving the application of learned patterns and knowledge to produce relevant responses or predictions. \nAttacks designed to disrupt service, deplete the target's financial resources, or even steal intellectual property by cloning a model’s behavior all depend on a common class of security vulnerability in order to succeed. Unbounded Consumption occurs when a Large Language Model (LLM) application allows users to conduct excessive and uncontrolled inferences, leading to risks such as denial of service (DoS), economic losses, model theft, and service degradation. The high computational demands of LLMs, especially in cloud environments, make them vulnerable to resource exploitation and unauthorized usage.",
