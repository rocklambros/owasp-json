      "title": "Agent Goal Hijack",
      "description": "AI Agents exhibit autonomous ability to execute a series of tasks to achieve a goal. Due to inherent weaknesses in how natural-language instructions and related content are processed, agents and the underlying model cannot reliably distinguish instructions from related content. \nAs a result, attackers can manipulate an agent’s objectives, task selection, or decision pathways through a variety of techniques -including, but not limited to, prompt-based manipulation, deceptive tool outputs, malicious artefacts, forged agent-to-agent messages, or poisoned external data. Because agents rely on untyped natural-language inputs and loosely governed orchestration logic, they cannot reliably distinguish legitimate instructions from attacker -controlled content. Unlike LLM01:2025, which focuses on altering a single model response, ASI01 captures the broader agentic impact where manipulated inputs redirect goals, panning (when used) and multi-step behavior. \nAgent Goal Hijack differs from ASI06 (Memory & Context Poisoning) and ASI10 (Rogue Agents) because the attacker directly alters the agent’s goals, instructions, or decision pathways -regardless of whether the manipulation occurs interactively or through pre-positioned inputs such as documents, templates, or external data sources. ASI06 focuses on the persistent corruption of stored context or long-term memory, while ASI10 captures autonomous misalignment that emerges without active attacker control. In the OWASP Agentic AI Threats & Mitigations Guide, ASI01 corresponds to T06 Goal Manipulation (altering the agent’s objectives) and T07 Misaligned & Deceptive Behaviors (bypassing safeguards or deceiving humans). Together, these illustrate how attackers can subvert the agent’s objectives and action-selection logic, redirecting its autonomy toward unintended or harmful outcomes.",

      "description": "Agents can misuse legitimate tools due to prompt injection, misalignment, or unsafe delegation or ambiguous instruction -leading to data exfiltration, tool output manipulation or workflow hijacking. Risks arise from how the agent chooses and applies tools; agent memory, dynamic tool selection, and delegation can contribute to misuse via chaining, privilege escalation, and unintended actions. This relates to LLM06:2025 (Excessive Agency), which addresses excessive autonomy but focuses on the misuse of legitimate tools. \nThis entry covers cases where the agent operates within its authorized privileges but applies a legitimate tool in an unsafe or unintended way -for example deleting valuable data, over-invoking costly APIs, or exfiltrating information. If the misuse involves privilege escalation or credential inheritance, it falls under ASI03 (Identity & Privilege Abuse); if the misuse results in arbitrary or injected code execution, it is classified under ASI05 (Unexpected Code Execution). Finally, tool definitions increasingly come via MCP servers, creating a natural overlap with ASI04 (Agentic Supply Chain Vulnerabilities). \nThe entry maps to T2 Tool Misuse in the Agentic AI Threats and Mitigations Guide whilst T4 Resource Overload and T16 Insecure Inter-Agent Protocol Abuse represent contributing factors that can amplify or enable tool exploitation.

      "title": "Identity and PrivilegeAbuse",
      "description": "Identity & Privilege Abuse exploits dynamic trust and delegation in agents to escalate access and bypass controls by manipulating delegation chains, role inheritance, control flows, and agent context; context includes cached credentials or conversation history across interconnected systems. In this context, identity refers both to the agent’s defined persona and to any authentication material that represents it. Agent-toagent trust or inherited credentials can be exploited to escalate access, hijack privileges, or execute unauthorized actions. \nThis risk arises from the architectural mismatch between user-centric identity systems and agentic design. Without a distinct, governed identity of its own, an agent operates in an attribution gap that makes enforcing true least privilege impossible. Identity in this context includes both the agent’s assigned persona and any authentication material (API keys, OAuth tokens, delegated user sessions) that represent it. \nThis differs scenario in ASI02 (Tools Misuse) which is an unintended or unsafe use of already granted privilege by a principal misusing its own tools. \nIdentity & Privilege Abuse is the agentic evolution of Excessive Agency (LLM06:2025). It often leverages Prompt Injection (LLM01:2025), and because of agent permissions, tool integrations, and multi-agent systems, the impact can amplify and exceed Sensitive Information Disclosure (LLM02:2025) to directly compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data the agent can reach. \nIn the OWASP ASI Threats and Mitigations, it maps one-to-one to T3: Privilege Compromise, and in OWASP AIVSS it corresponds to Core Risk 2: Agent Access Control Violation.",

Context includes any information an agent retains, retrieves, or reuses, such as summaries, embeddings, and RAG stores but excludes one-time input prompts covered under LLM01 :2025 Prompt Injection. \nIn Memory and Context Poisoning, adversaries corrupt or seed this context with malicious or misleading data, causing future reasoning, planning, or tool use to become biased, unsafe, or aid exfiltration. Ingestion sources such as uploads, API feeds, user input, or peer-agent exchanges may be untrusted or only partially validated. \nThis risk is distinct from ASI01 (Goal Hijack), which captures direct goal manipulation, and ASI08 (Cascading Failures), which describes degradation after poisoning occurs. However, memory poisoning frequently leads to goal hijacking (ASI01), as corrupted context or long-term memory can alter the agent’s goal interpretation, reasoning path, or tool-selection logic. \nIt builds on LLM01:2025 Prompt Injection, LLM04:2025 Data and Model Poisoning, and LLM08:2025 Vector and Embedding Weaknesses, but focuses on persistent corruption of agent memory and retrievable context that propagates across sessions and alters autonomous reasoning. \nIt maps to T1 Memory Poisoning in Agentic Threats and Mitigations, with related impacts in T4 Memory Overload, T6 Broken Goals, and T12 Shared Memory Poisoning.

      "description": "Agentic cascading failures occur when a single fault (hallucination, malicious input, corrupted tool, or poisoned memory) propagates across autonomous agents, compounding into system-wide harm. Because agents plan, persist, and delegate autonomously, a single error can bypass stepwise human checks and persist in a saved state. As agents form emergent links to new tools or peers, these latent faults chain into privileged operations that compromise confidentiality, integrity, availability, leading to widespread service failures across agent networks, systems, and workflows. \nCascading Failures describes the propagation and amplification of an initial fault-not the initial vulnerability itself-across agents, tools, and workflows, turning a single error into system-wide impact. \nASI08 focuses on the propagation and amplification of faults rather than their origin. Use the initial defect under ASI04, ASI06, or ASI07 when it represents a direct compromise -such as a tainted dependency, poisoned memory, or spoofed message -and apply ASI08 only when that defect spreads across agents, sessions, or workflows, causing measurable fan-out or systemic impact beyond the original breach. \nObservable symptoms include rapid fan-out where one faulty decision triggers many downstream agents or tasks in a short time, cross-domain or tenant spread beyond the original context, oscillating retries or feedback loops between agents, and downstream queue storms or repeated identical intents-each providing clear detection hooks that make ASI08 operationally actionable. \nCascading failures amplify across interconnected agents, chaining OWASP LLM Top 10 risks. LLM01:2025 Prompt Injection and LLM06:2025 Excessive Agency can trigger autonomous tool runs that spread errors without human checks, while LLM04:2025 Data and Model Poisoning in persistent memory can skew decisions across sessions and workflows. Agentic AI -Threats and Mitigations 1.1 covers this threat in T5 – Cascading Hallucination Attacks while T8 – Repudiation and Untraceability highlights a fundamental defense: the ability to trace, attribute, and audit cascading behaviors through resilient logging and non-repudiation mechanisms that prevent silent propagation. However, these compounding threats illustrate a potential discrepancy in the speed and scale of fault propagation in a multi-agent system and the ability of humans to keep up with them to ensure secure and effective operation of the system. This leaves some unmitigated risks that the enterprise must evaluate carefully to ensure they are within the overall risk budget for the organization.",

        "Identity Attestation and Behavioral Integrity Enforcement: Implement per-agent cryptographic identity attestation and enforce behavioral integrity baselines throughout the agent lifecycle. Attach signed behavioral manifests declaring expected capabilities, tools, and goals that are validated by orchestration services before each action. Integrate a behavioral verification layer that continuously monitors tasks for deviations from the declared manifest for e.g. unapproved tool invocations, unexpected data exfiltration attempts etc.",
        "Require periodic behavioral attestation: challenge tasks, signed bill of materials for prompts and tools, and per-run ephemeral credentials with one-time audience binding. All signing and attestation mechanisms assume hardened cryptographic key management (e.g., HSM/KMS-backed keys, least privilege access, rotation and revocation). Keys must never be directly available to agents; instead, orchestrators should mediate signing operations so that a compromised agent cannot simply exfiltrate or misuse long-lived keys",
        "Recovery and Reintegration: Establish trusted baselines for restoring quarantined or remediated agents. Require fresh attestation, dependency verification, and human approval before reintegration into production networks."
